# Passwordchecker
This is a Python Project that checks whether a userâ€™s password is strong and secure by evaluating it against four common security rules. 
It provides helpful feedback if the password doesn't meet any of the rules. The rules of which are:
-Minimum of 8 characters

-At least one uppercase letter

-At least one digit

-At least one special character from: !@#$%^&*

Gives clear feedback if the password fails any of the rules.

If all rules are satisfied, it prints "Password is valid."
